# FAQ

### Do you support synonyms?

Yes! Including US to UK spelling synonyms by default!

### Fast?

Yes, very fast

### Why do I need to name my index?

You have a name yourself, don't you? It makes sense to name the index too.

### I would like a feature to be added!

I would like an issue to be created

### Dealing with errors

Especially when using facets, you should not redeclare fields to be filterable as well. If you run in to an error 
saying you have duplicate fields, check your configuration for overlaps
e.g. FilterFields does not have an overlap with FacetFields

### @package tag

The package tag is to help the API documentation to stay up to date.

We are aware it's a bit of overkill and redundant, but it does not have any impact on the actual code.

## Your software is free and open, isn't it?

Yes, but it still costs us time to respond to issues, look at pull requests
or even support you with problems outside of the module.

We are happy to help you, but we have put a lot of time and effort in to writing software
that is useful to you, the community. We ask you, would you give something back?
It is not mandatory, of course.

We will add you to the list of sponsors, if you decide to thank the maintainers for this
work.
